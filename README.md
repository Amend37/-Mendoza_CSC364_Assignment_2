How to Run:

start server- 
python server/server.py

By default, this starts the server on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) using port 5000.
You can also specify your own host and port:

python server.py <host> <port>


start client: (make sure on diff terminal than server )

python client/client.py <server_host> <port> <username>

Example:
python client/client.py localhost 5000 Anthony
