How to Run:

start server- 
python server/server.py

You can also edit HOST and PORT in server.py if you want to host it on your local network (e.g., 192.x.x.x).

start client: (make sure on diff terminal than server )
python client/client.py <server_host> <port> <username>

Example:
python client/client.py localhost 5000 Anthony
